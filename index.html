            <h3>The Magic of Glowing Creatures</h3>

            <div id="Glowing1">
                <p>Did you know some animals and plants can glow in the dark? This cool trick is called bioluminescence. It happens when a special chemical reaction inside their bodies creates light. It’s like nature’s version of neon lights!

                <h4>Here's how it works</h4>
            </div>
            <div id="Glowing2">
                <p>1.A molecule called luciferin mixes with oxygen.</p>
                <p>2.An enzyme called luciferase helps speed up the process.</p>
                <p>3.Voilà! A glow appears, but without heat – it’s called “cold light.”</p>

                    <li>Deep-sea fish: They use it to scare predators or lure prey.</li>
                    <li>Fungi and plants: Some even glow to attract bugs or spread spores!</li>
